# YouTube to Spotify Playlist Migrator - Adam Funk
This program is directly based from the code in the video 'Automate Spotify with Python' provided by @bukola.dev on her YouTube account 'The Come Up'. I have provided a link to the video and Bukola's contact information in the Additional Notes section.

This program takes songs in a YouTube account's Liked video list, and migrates them to a playlist in a Spotify account. To run the application, run the following command:
    python playlist_migrator.py
